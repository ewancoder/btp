Big Typernatural Project Documentation
**************************************

**Big TyperNatural Project, BTP** is a **game** written in **Python**, powered by **PyGame** and based on **keyboard typing** so this game doesn't even have mouse support. And this is not a trouble at all - it's a feature.

.. note::
   If you just want to start playing, you can go to :ref:`quickstart` page.

These docs are powered by **Sphinx** and intended to help both **users** to start playing and any **developers** (including me) to understand actual code and maintain it easily with comprehension of each and single line. Thus, these docs have both "user" side and "developer" side, which are actually pretty entwined together.

Your way around
===============

If you are just user who wanna play, use :ref:`quickstart` guide. If you want to read about the game something more, you can read :doc:`about` section as well as whole :doc:`use`.

For developers, however, there's :doc:`dev` page. Also you can check out :doc:`features` page to see what have been done so far and what is intended to be done.
