Big TyperNatural Project (BTP)
==============================

This is text-based RPG game with typo-control, written basically for learning cause but also to provide great game with non-standard control (which I adore). There're very few games with typo-control, so I've decided to make one.

Firstly game was in a very raw stage of development, where commits were dirty and without proper description. Then I've made "refactoring" stage where I put everything right (almost). And now I'm back at developing the game from the clean start, featuring split-developing of game and documentation (in different branches) for clean coding.

Documentation was first written in sphinx, but then I've learned LaTeX and decided to switch. By now, I am planning on making both Sphinx and LaTeX documentation sources.

There are some key points here
------------------------------

1. Game written in **python** using **pygame**.
2. Main concept - **typo** approach of control.
3. **Text**-based **rpg** quest game, yet with some fancy sprites and **animation**.
4. **Huge world** with lots of capabilities, **crafting**, building structures, etc. Interact with all the objects using your keyboard.
5. Totally **open-source** and free (GPL).

Branches
--------

Actual branches - **master**, **dev** and **docs**.

* **master** - main branch of (mostly) **stable** releases;
* **dev** - **development** branch where all the work is done;
* **docs** - separate branch for the project **documentation**.

Other branches:

* **req** - old abandoned branch for some dirty 'req' function or somewhat, I forgot already;
* **refactoring** - branch for **refactoring**, abandoned now but maybe I'll be back on there someday.
